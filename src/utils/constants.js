  ACTIONS: (cv, job) => `
    Based on this CV and Job Description:
    CV: ${cv}
    Job Description: ${job}

    Analyze the gaps between the CV and job requirements, then provide specific, actionable improvements.
    For each improvement, carefully evaluate its priority based on:
    1. Alignment with core job requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
    2. Potential impact on application success
    3. Competitive advantage gained

    Format the response as a JSON array:
    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "title": "string (category of improvement)",
          "action": "string (specific action to take)",
          "priority": "high|medium|low",
          "reasoning": "string (brief explanation of why this matters)"
        }
      ]
    }

    Priority Guidelines:
    - High: Critical for meeting core job requirements or significant competitive advantage
    - Medium: Important but not critical, or longer-term improvements
    - Low: Nice-to-have improvements or minimal impact on application success

    Keep the total number of actions between 5-7 items.
    Order actions by priority (high to low).
    Make each action specific, measurable, and directly tied to job requirements.
